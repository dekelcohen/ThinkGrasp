Likely causes span perception, grasp scoring/selection, and physics/control. Here are the highest‑impact ones with code hotspots to check.

  Perception / Point Cloud

  - Incorrect crop bounds in utils.get_and_process_data can clip or misplace the ROI.
      - utils.py:187 sets xmax=480, ymax=640 for a 480x640 image; width/height are swapped. Use xmax=640, ymax=480 and clamp to image dims. This can starve the
        point cloud or bias it left.
  - Naive image→workspace mapping in simulation_main.py:101 crop_pointcloud(...) ignores camera intrinsics; points become “pixels with z”, not metric world
    coordinates. GraspNet will then score/pose on a corrupted cloud.
  - Depth units/scale mismatches. utils.get_true_heightmap returns depth in meters from PyBullet; CameraInfo in utils.py:170 uses scale=1000.0. Verify the
    expected depth units for create_point_cloud_from_depth_image to avoid mm/m confusion.

  Grasp Generation / Filtering

  - Tight thresholds filter out good grasps:
      - grasp_detetor.py:32 uses dist_thresh=0.05 (5 cm) and angle_thresh=15° cone. If objects are larger or cluttered, you’ll get few valid grasps and may
        fall back to worse ones.

  Physics / Control

  - Insufficient friction/force or object dynamics:
      - environment_sim.py:429 sets finger pad lateralFriction=0.9. Heavy/smooth objects may slip; increase pad/object friction or gripper closing force.
  - Approach path/tip offset:
      - environment_sim.py:396–416 transforms pose to the EE tip and subtracts 0.02 on Z. If the approach vector is off or Z is too low, you hit the table or
        object edges.
  - IK and straight‑line motion:
      - environment_sim.py:296 and environment_sim.py:319 perform IK and straight moves with a force threshold; premature stop or bad IK can miss alignment.

  Segmentation / Targeting

  - Avoid simulation_main.py:101 crop_pointcloud for grasping; build clouds via utils.create_point_cloud_from_depth_image and correct intrinsics.
  - Tune physics:
      - Increase gripper pad/object friction, closing force, and reduce angle_thresh if you want more top‑down grasps.
  - Validate units:
      - Ensure depth scale matches CameraInfo and PyBullet outputs; inspect a few sampled points for metric consistency.
